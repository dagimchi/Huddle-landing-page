## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Absolutely positioned elements do not respect their parent's padding. You can set `padding: inherit` on the absolutely positioned element to get around the issue.

### Continued development

- Figure out how to more effectively place elements in a certain space across all screen sizes. The social media links were tricky to place.

### Useful resources
